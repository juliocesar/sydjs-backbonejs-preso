"But that's pretty slow!"

Not if you do it right. Use JS loaders such as [yepnope.js](http://yepnopejs.com/)
or [LABjs](http://labjs.com/). There's a good comparison sheet [here](https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Aqln2akPWiMIdERkY3J2OXdOUVJDTkNSQ2ZsV3hoWVE#gid=0).

Bundle your JS/CSS. Using Ruby? Go for [rack-pagespeed](http://rack-pagespeed.heroku.com/). \*wink\*

And don't suck. That usually helps.
